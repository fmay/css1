You should now see a different web page appear. Let's see what we've added.

## Tags we've used
- `<h1>Heading</h1>` gives you a level 1 heading. This is usually the largest one.
- `<h2>Smaller heading</h2>` gives you a level 2 heading. This is a bit smaller than the `<h1>`.
- `<p>Hello there!!!</p>` gives you a paragraph. 
- You'll notice that we have `... and goodbye` without any tags around it. In fact it does have tags around it! It is within the `<body>` tag! Putting text here is generally a bad idea (we'll explain another time) but it works.

## Change it
Feel free to go ahead and change the contents of the `index.html` file. Don't worry if you wreck it.
