One important habit you should get into is to nicely indent your code.

Take a look at the code on the left hand side. Notice that each line starts right at the beginning of the line. This is bad!

## How it should look
Below is the same code as you see on the left, but nicely indented. Notice how you can add extra line breaks to make things even clearer. This won't affect the way it appears when it runs.

Read the tips below then indent the code so it looks nice and tidy.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

  <head>
      <title></title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>Puppies and Kittens</h1>
    <p>Here is a cute picture.</p>
    <img src="cute.jpg" alt="A cute puppy and kitten.">
  </body> 
  
</html>
```

## Ways to indent
You can indent your code in any of the following ways

- put the cursor at the start of the line and press the space bar (not a good way)
- put the cursor at the start of the line and press the tab key (good way)
- highlight several lines and press the tab key; all highligjted lines will indent

## Beautifying
Go to the 'Tools' menu and select 'Beautify'. This is a really good way of tidying up the entire file with a single click. There are two ways to use this

- To beautify the entire file, click somewhere within the file first.
- To beautify just a prtion of the file, highlight the lines you want to beautify and then run the Beautify command.
