A web page is typically read from a file that lives on a server somewhere on the internet.

On the left hand side is a so-called file tree. This is where files are stored. We'll talk about this more soon.

You can see an opened file `index.html` on the left. What you are seeing is a very basic web page.

It looks a little scary with all those *tags* like `<html>` and `<body>` and so on. Don't worry, you'll soon get used to them. 

## The body element
The normal content of a web page goes inside the 'body' of the page. You can see that we have written 'Hello there!!!' into the `<body>` part of the page.

## The Preview window
In the window below `index.html` is the 'Preview' window. This shows what happens when your browser runs the web page.

Go ahead and change the `Hello there!!!` text to something else. Next, press the 'Reload Preview' button in the preview window.

You should see your changes shown nicely.
