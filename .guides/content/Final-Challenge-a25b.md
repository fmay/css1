So let's see if you have remembered what you learned so far.

## Create your own page
You should create your own web page by modifying `index.html` on the left. 

Proceed one item at a time and then reload the Preview to check how you are doing. Don't feel you have to do it all at once before checking.

Here's what we want you to have on your page.

1. A first level header with any text you like.
1. Beneath this there should be some text in a `<p>` tag.
1. Create a second level header with the text 'Images'.
1. Display the puppy and kitten image.
1. Put some text in a `<p>` tag that acts as a description for the image.
1. Display the ugly mole rat.
1. Put some text in a `<p>` tag beneath the rat that contains the word 'ugly', which should be in bold.
