We have been talking about tags a lot. So what is a tag?

|||definition
- A tag defines an HTML element like `<body>`, or `<h1>` or `<p>`.
- Tags most often come in pairs, so `<h1> ... </h1>`, with the first one commonly known as the *starting* tag and the second one known as the *closing* tag.
- The closing tag is the same as the opening tag but starts with the `/` character (`</h1>` closes `<h1>`).

**It is really, really important that you get the opening and closing tags right or your page will not display properly.**
