We have been talking about tags a lot. So what is a tag?

|||definition
- A tag defines an HTML element like `<body>`, or `<h1>` or `<p>`.
- Tags most often come in pairs, so `<h1> ... </h1>`, with the first one commonly known as the starting tag and the second one known as the closing tag.
- The closing tag is the same as the opening tag but starts with the `/` character (`</h1>`).

**It is really, really important that you get the opening and closing tags right or your page will not display properly.**

## The browser
As you know, browsers are used to display web pages. The `.html` file (`index.html` in our example on the left), is sent from the web server to the browser, over the Internet in most cases, exactly as you see it.

The browser then reads the tags and displays the HTML elements exactly as you see in the Preview window.

The font sizes you see for our very boring page are what the browser's *default* settings for our tags. Later we will see how we can change these.
