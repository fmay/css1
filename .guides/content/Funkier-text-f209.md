Our page is still boring, so let's make it a tiny bit more interesting.

Rather than doing it for you, we'll tell you what to do and you add it yourself.

## Bold, underlined and italic text

The way you do this is to use tags to enclose the piece of text you want to change in order to get the right effect.

Here are some tips and clues

- Try just bold first before you do all 3. This way you can be sure you have understood the idea first.
- The tag for bold is `<b>`
- The tag for underlined is `<u>`
- The tag for italic is `<i>`

**Important** : you need opening and closing tags for all these. Try and see what happens if you don't.

**Also imporant** : after you've made your changes, press the Reload Preview button.
